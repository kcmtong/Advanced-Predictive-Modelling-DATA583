```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## EDA



```{r}
le <- read.csv("dataset/LifeExpectancy.csv")
summary(le)
```

```{r}
head(le)

# le
# Part 1 : Data Wrangling

### Create a new column Status.val to represent the Status column with number
le$Status.val <- ifelse(le$Status == "Developed",1,0)


#### SCALING : To be determined
le$GDP_scaled = scale(le$GDP)  # Population has a substantially large figure
# le$Population_scaled = scale(le$Population) # Population has a substantially large figure, but not used as predictive variable in our project





```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
